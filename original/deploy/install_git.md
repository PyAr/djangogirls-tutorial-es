### Windows

You can download Git from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/). You can hit "next next next" on all steps except for one; in the 5th step entitled "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose "Run Git and associated Unix tools from the Windows command-line" (the bottom option). Other than that, the defaults are fine. Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings is good.

### MacOS

Download Git from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/) and just follow the instructions.


### Linux

If it isn't installed already, git should be available via your package manager, so try:


#### Debian or Ubuntu

    $ sudo apt-get install git


#### Fedora (up to 21)

    $ sudo yum install git


#### Fedora (22+)

    $ sudo dnf install git
